## Running locally

Clone the repo and install deps:

## Contributing

To add an example of a new library:

1. Create a copy of any folder (e.g. `emotion/`)
2. Rename the folder and the `package` field in the folder's package.json
3. Update the code (dependencies, imports, etc). Try to keep the actual styles more or less the same.
4. Update the README.md
